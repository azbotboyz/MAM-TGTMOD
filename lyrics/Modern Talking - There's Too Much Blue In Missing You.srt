00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,800
Like the leaves fall of a tree

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,610
I feel your love is dying for me

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,020
You tell me it's not the end

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,240
Where is the love you forsake

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,570
You forsake, you forsake

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:58,280
There's too much blue in missing you

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,380
I believe I was a fool

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,450
Before you say goodbey

13
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,290
Oh, give us one more try

14
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,020
Yet I can't forget all the love we had
