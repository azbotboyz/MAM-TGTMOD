00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,480
I was lost and alone

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,280
Trying to grow,

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,890
making my way down that long winding road

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,310
Had no reason, no rhyme

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,550
Like a song out of time

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,780
And there you were, standing in front of my eyes

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,380
How could I be such a fool

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,970
To let go of love and break all the rules

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,030
Girl when you walked out that door

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,780
left a hole in my heart

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,130
And now I know for sure

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,360
You're the air that I breathe

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,370
Girl you're all that I need

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,950
And I wanna thank you, lady

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,560
You're the words that I read

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,680
You're the light that I see

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,850
And your love is all that I need

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,790
I was searching in vain

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,380
Playing a game

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,050
Had no-one else but myself left to blame

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,070
You came into my world

32
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,750
No diamonds or pearls

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,930
Could ever replace what you gave to me girl

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,040
Just like a castle of sand

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,000
Girl, I almost let love slip right out of my hands

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And just like a flower needs rain

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,250
I will stand by your side through the joy and the pain

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,490
You're the air that I breathe

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,630
Girl you're all that I need

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,200
