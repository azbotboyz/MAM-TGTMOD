6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,110
Think about the generations and to say

7
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,600
we want to make it a better

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,470
world for our children and our children's children.

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,330
So that they know

10
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,380
it's a better world for them;

11
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,310
and think if they can make it a better place.

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,000
There's a place in your heart

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I know that it is love

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And this place could be much

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Brighter than tomorrow

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And if you really try

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You'll find there's no need to cry

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In this place you'll feel

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's no hurt or sorrow

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There are ways to get there

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you care enough for the living

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,050
Make a little space

23
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,000
Make a better place ...

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Heal the world

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,930
Make it a better place

26
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,000
For you and for me

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And the entire human race

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
There are people dying

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,930
If you care enough for the living

30
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,400
Make it a better place

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,600
For you and for me

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,000
If you want to know why

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There's love that cannot lie

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Love is strong

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,170
It only cares of joyful giving

36
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,320
If we try we shall see

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,200
In this bliss we cannot feel

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,830
Fear od dread

39
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,800
We stop existing and start living

40
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,630
The it feels that always

41
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,290
Love's enough for us growing

42
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,280
So make a better world

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,330
Make a better place ...

44
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,810
Heal the world

45
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,060
Make it a better place

46
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,000
For you and for me

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And the entire human race

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,130
There are people dying

49
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,010
If you care enough for the living

50
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:11,170
Make a better place for you and for me

51
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,000
And the dream we were conceived in

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,020
Will reveal a joyful face

53
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,000
And the world we once believed in

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,880
Will shine again in grace

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,980
Then why do we keep strangling life

56
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,910
Wound this earth, crucify its soul

57
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,330
Though it's plain to see

58
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,940
This world is heavenly

59
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,580
Be god's glow

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,170
We could fly so high

61
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,220
Let our spirits never die

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,090
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers

63
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,010
Create a world with no fear

64
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,970
Together we cry happy tears

65
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:58,440
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,650
We could really get there

67
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,450
If you cared enough for the living

68
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,270
Make a little space

69
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,580
To make a better place ...

70
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,600

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,990
