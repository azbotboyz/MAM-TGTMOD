00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,810
If I could reach the stars

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,530
Pull one down for you

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,580
Shine it on my heart

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,570
So you could see the truth

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,410
That this love I have inside

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,000
Is everything it seems

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But for now I find

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's only in my dreams

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If I can change the world

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I would be the sunlight in your universe

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You would think my love was really something good

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,880
Baby if I could change the world

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If I could be king

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Even for a day

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,190
I'd take you as my queen

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,290
I'd have no other way

26
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,120
And our love will rule

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,100
In this kingdom we have made

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,980
'Til then I'll be a fool

29
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,630
Wishing for the day

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,350
If I can change the world

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,450
I would be the sunlight in your universe

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,490
You would think my love was really something good

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:33,170
