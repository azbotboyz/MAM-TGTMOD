6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,900
Every where I go all the places that I've been

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,470
Every smile is a new horizon

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,570
On a land I've never seen

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,150
There are people around the world

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,350
Different faces,defferent names

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,740
But that's one true emotion

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,100
That reminds me we aren't the same

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,980
Let's talk about love

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,470
From the laughter of a child

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,280
To the tears of a grown man

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,800
There's a thread

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,170
That runs straight through us

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,030
And helps us understand

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,570
And subtle as a breeze

20
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,610
That fans a flicker to a frame

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,090
From the very first sweet melody

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,420
To the very last refrain

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,010
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us

24
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:34,690
Let's talk about life, let's talk about trust

25
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,090
Let's talk about love

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,370
It's the king of all who live

32
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,440
And queen of all good hearts

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,340
It's the one you may keep up your sleeve

34
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,070
'Til the name is all out lost

35
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,920
As deep as any sea

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,810
with the rage of any storm

37
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,570
But as gentle as a falling leaf

38
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,840
On any autumn morn

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,210
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:37,990
Let's talk about life, let's talk about trust

41
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,720
Let's talk about love, it's all we are needing

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,640
Let's talk about us, it's the air we're breathing

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,430
Let's talk about life, I wanna know you

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,400
Let's talk about trust, I wanna show you

45
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,420
Every where I go all the places that I've been

46
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,180
Every smile is a new horizon

47
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,140
On a land I've never seen

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,890
There are people around the world

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,840
Different faces, defferent names

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,390
But that's one true emotion

51
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,130
That reminds me we aren't the same

52
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:43,050
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us

53
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:50,680
Let's talk about life, let's talk about trust

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,210
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us

55
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's talk about life, let's talk about trust

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,690
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us

57
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:21,270
Let's talk about life, let's talk about trust

58
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:29,060
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:36,710
Let's talk about life, let's talk about trust

60
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:44,330
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us

61
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:52,050
Let's talk about life, let's talk about trust

62
00:04:52,050 --> 00:05:01,766
Let's talk about love, let's talk about us
