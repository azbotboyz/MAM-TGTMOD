1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:16,600
Now and forever

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Until the time is through

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,930
I can't believe it

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,340
I don't know where to start

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,510
No baby

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,000
So many questions

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,590
Deep inside of my heart

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,630
Give me a moment before you go

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,180
There's something you ought to know

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,290
Baby ,now and forever

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,690
Until the time is through

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,930
I'll be stand here

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,550
Waiting and never

14
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,960
Give up my faith in you

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,130
Try to make it clear

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,030
Without your love

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,270
I'll be half a man

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,130
Maybe one day

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,440
You 'll understand

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,870
Now and forever

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:21,830
Until the time through

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,700
I'll be waiting

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,160
How can I tell you

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,660
So that you can see

25
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,900
You know that

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,440
Love has a meaning

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,970
When you are here with me

28
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,030
Give me a moment before you go

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,600
There's something you ought to know

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,650
Baby, now and forever

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,770
Until the time is through

32
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,310
I'll be stand here

33
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,930

34
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,400
Give up my faith in you

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,510
Try to make it clear

36
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,280
Without your love

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,550
I'll be half a man

38
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,360
Maybe one day

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,600
You 'll understand

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,140
Now and forever

41
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,000
Until the time through

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,170
There is no one to comfort me

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,150
Here in my cold reality

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm searching for words

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,130
What can I say

46
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,420
To make you see

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,150

Give up my faith in you

58
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,190
Try to make it clear

59
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,980
Without your love
