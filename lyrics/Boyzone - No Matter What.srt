7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,680
No matter what they tell us

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,860
No matter what they do

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,990
No matter what they teach us

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,920
What we believe it's true

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,220
No matter what they call us

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,610
However they attack

13
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,770
No matter where they take us

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,440
We'll find our own way back

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,340
I can't deny what I believe

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,690
I can't be what I'm not

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,790

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,590
I know no matter what

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,250
If only tears were laughter(ooh)

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,350
If only night was day(ooh)

21
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,000
If only prayers were answered

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
(hear my prayers)

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,310
Then we could hear God say(say)

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,840
No matter what they tell you

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,000
No matter what they do

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,100
No matter what they teach you

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,960
What you believe it's true

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:10,890
And I will keep you safe and strong

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,000
And shelter from the storm

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,160
No matter where it's barren

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,390
A dream is being born

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,690
Or if the skies are blue

44
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,410
(skies are blue)

45
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,560
No matter what the end is

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,770
My life began with you

47
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't deny what I believe

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,180
I know this love's forever

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,330
That's all that matters now

53
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,540
