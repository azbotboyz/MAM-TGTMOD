00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,870
Lying in your arms

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,050
So close together

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,400
Didn't know just what i had

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,760
Now i toss and turn

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,190

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,090

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,880
Where was my heart

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,110
Now i cry alone in the dark

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,030

Undying devotion

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,160

29
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,890
