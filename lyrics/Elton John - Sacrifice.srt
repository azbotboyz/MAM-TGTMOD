6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,170
It's a human sign

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,400
When things go wrong

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,500
When the scent of her lingers

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,230
And temptation's strong

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,220
Into the boundary

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,260
Of each married man

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,430
Sweet deceit comes calling

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,910
And negativity lands

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,230
Cold cold heart

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,430
Hard done by you

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,910
Some things look better baby

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,590
Just passing through

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,700
And it's no sacrifice

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,870
Just a simple word

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,720
It's two hearts living

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,420
In two separate worlds

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,880
But it's no sacrifice

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,360
No sacrifice

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,440
It's no sacrifice at all

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,880
Mutual misunderstanding

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,500
After the fact

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,740
Sensitivity builds a prison

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,950
In the final act

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,000
We lose direction

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,170
No stone unturned

36
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,400
No tears to damn you

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,820
When jealousy burns

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,670
Cold cold heart

39
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,910
Hard done by you

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,010
Some things look better baby

41
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,670

It's no sacrifice at all
