00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,370
Deep within each heart

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,890
There lies a magic spark

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:27,740
That lights the fire of our imagination

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,150
And since the dawn of man

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,730
The strenght of just "I can"

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,230
Has brought together people of all nations

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,020
There's nothing ordinary

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,020
In the living of each day

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,990
There's a special part

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,590
Every one of us will play

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,820
Feel the flame forever burn

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,270
Teaching lessons we must learn

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:08,110
To bring us closer to the power of the dream

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,340
As the world gives us its best

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,800
To stand apart from all the rest

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,870
It is the power of the dream that brings us here

The rest is just pure heart

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:44,680
You'll find your fate is all your own creation

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,480
Every boy and girl

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,600
As they come into this world

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,950
They bring the gift of hope and inspiration

Every woman child and man

46
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,380
It's the moment that you think you can't
