00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,640
Oh my heart is crying in the night for you

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,560
Oh, my God, oh don't you feel like a fool

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,630
You're fooling yourself with a millionaire

9
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,630
You think it's love but he don't care

10
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,610
And one of these days

11
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,530
You're gonna be surprised

12
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,500
Diamonds never made a lady, lover or a friend

13
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,620
I know it

14
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,520
Diamonds never made a lady, all your dreams will end

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,710
I know it

16
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,130
Your Californian nights

17
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,240
Warm body held you tight

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,100
Was just a dream

19
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,030
But all the diamond lights

20
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,080
Can't give you peacefull lives or sweet dreams

Oh my God, you really think you have it made

27
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:46,150
Your heart is won, with first class expenses paid

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,190
You drink champaign, eat caviar

29
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,120
A colour TV in the back of your car

30
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,170
But one of these days

31
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,480
You're gonna be surpised

32
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,160

Warm body held you tight

43
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,920
