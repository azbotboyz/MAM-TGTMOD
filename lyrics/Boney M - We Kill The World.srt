6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,980
I see mushrooms, atomic mushrooms.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,010
I see rockets, missiles in the sky.

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,820
Poor World, Poor World.

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,880
Concrete's rising up, where yearerday was park

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,120
you heard the Robin's Song

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,510
Heavy tractor runs

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,100
where air was clean and cool

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,530
make money, bringing fuel.

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,320
Where will this lead to

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,550
and what is this good for?

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,290
A Poor World, Poor World.

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,960
Fishes doomed to die

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,520
as people live close by

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,750
and oaktree falls with moon

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,130
Parking lots will come

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,740
with flowerfields were bright

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,880
as junkyard covers sight!

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,980
Where will this lead to

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,070
and what is this good for?

25
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,200
Poor world, is hurting bad,

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,170
Poor world, is doomed to die.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,690
We kill the world

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,110
kill the world

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,850
We surely do

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,090
In peace we do!

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,190
We kill the world

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,640
kill the world

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,410
'cause we don't know

34
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,540
what we are doing!

40
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,940
Promenades must go

41
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,680
so cars can drive in row

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
New Fact'ry towers tall

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,220
Farmhouse had to fall

44
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,840
No flowers in the air

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
pollution everywhere.

46
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,060
Where will this lead to

47
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,300
and what is this good for?

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,030
A Poor world, Poor World.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,680
We kill the world

50
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,220
kill the world

51

54
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,950
kill the world

55
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,660
'cause we don't know

56
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,510
what we are doing!

57
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,630
We kill the world

58
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,300
kill the world

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,080
We surely do

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,370
In peace we do!

61
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,430
We kill the world

62
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,110
Don't kill the world

63
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,620
don't let her down.

64
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:31,310
Do not destroy basic ground.

65
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,720
Don't kill the world

66
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,040
our means of life.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,940
Lend ear to nature's cry.

68
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,030
Don't kill the world

69
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,460
She's all we have,

70
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:58,110
And surely is worth to save.

71
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't let her die,

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,960
fight for her trees,

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,210
Pollution robs air to breathe.

74
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,640
Don't kill the world

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,940
help her survive

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,680
And she'll reward you with life

77
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,020
And don't just talk,

78
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:38,570
Go on and do the one, who wins is you.

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,510
Cherish the world,

80
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,820
A present from God

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,480
On behalf of all creatures,

82
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,870
made by the Lord

83
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,020
Care for the earth,

84
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,250
Foundation of life

85
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,540
Slow progress down help her survive

86
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,600
Don't kill the world

87
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,010
don't let her down.

88
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,720
Do not destroy basic ground.

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,050
Don't kill the world

90
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,750
our means of life.

91
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,010
Don't kill the world

92
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:53,201
our means of life.
