00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,730
When I think of you it압 just the same

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,830
This feeling it could never change

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,590
Believe me

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,730
It fills me up with joy and happiness

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,590
Though there is only emptiness

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,460
Around me

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,520
In the night

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,260
All I do is run

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,680
Run away

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,980
From all what압 in my head, my heart, my soul

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,220
Trying to forget

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,650
So I fight a war so lost

18
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,760
I just can앖 win

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,820
But something deep inside tells me

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,420
Hold on, not to give in

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,520
When will you see

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,070
You still belong to me

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,210
Wishing you were here now

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,920
Let your inside outside

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,270
Open your heart and love you앏l find

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,140
I앐 wishing you were here now

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,880
Trying to find a way out

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,830
Out of this confusion in my mind

29
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:51,260

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,310

I wanna know

32

In the streets a million people pass me by

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,830
In every face I see your eyes

34
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,680
Still shining

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,790
Ooh, I miss your caring warm embrace

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,890
Your tender touch, your kisses taste

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,170
Just crying

38
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,830
So I fight a war so lost I cannot win

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,500
There압 something deep inside tells me

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,430
