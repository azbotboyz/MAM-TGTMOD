00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,360
By the rivers of Babylon

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,270
There we sat down

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,320
Ye-eah we wept

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,920
When we remembered Zion.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,740
By the rivers of Babylon

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,890
There we sat down

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,800
Ye-eah we wept

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,620
When we remembered Zion.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,080
When the wicked

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,950
Carried us away in captivity

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,550
Required from us a song

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,360
Now how shall

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,200
We sing the lord's song in a strange land

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,060
When the wicked

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,290
Carried us away in captivity

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,220
Requiering of us a song

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,150
Now how shall

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:48,970
We sing the lord's song in a strange land

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,960
Let the words of our mouth

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,120
And the meditations of our heart

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:05,550
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight

27
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,570
Let the words of our mouth

28
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,670
And the meditation of our hearts

29
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:21,890
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight

30
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,690
By the rivers of Babylon

31
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,910
There we sat down

32
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,990
Ye-eah we wept

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,680
Ye-eah we wept

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:11,640
When we remembered Zion.

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,620
By the rivers of Babylon

39
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,790
There we sat down

40
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,840
Ye-eah we wept
