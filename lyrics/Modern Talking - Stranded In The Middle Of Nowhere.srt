00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,200
Show me a dream of love

Albatross

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:39,590
Without her love I'm lost

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,540
Good love never dies

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,240
Angels never fly so high

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,090
I'm dreaming, dreaming

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,010
Coming back to me

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:07,010
I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere, take care

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:18,030
I'm stranded in a struggle of my dreams, it seemes

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,720
Baby, oh I need you more

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,540
Like roses need the rain

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,470
Baby, oh I need you more

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,530
Come and take my hand

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:18,250
Don't leave me alone - I'm sad

28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,830
Oh, I find my home

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,540
Right back where I started from

30
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,540
I'm dreaming, dreaming

31
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,390

I'm stranded

41
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,630
I don't know where but you're not theree

42
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,820
I'm stranded

43
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,300
Playing the fool, breaking the rules

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,310
I'm stranded

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,890
Take up your hand, make me a friend

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,970
I'm stranded
