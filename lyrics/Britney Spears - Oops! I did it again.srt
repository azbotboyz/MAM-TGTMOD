6
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,300
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,350
I think I did it again

8
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,840
I made you believe

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,080
we're more than just friends

10
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,240
Oh baby

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,720
It might seem like a crush

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,360
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,720
'Cause to lose all my senses

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,500
That is just so typically me

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,130
Oh baby, baby

16
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,660
Oops!...I did it again

17
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,580
I played with your heart, got lost in the game

18
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,070
Oh baby, baby

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,770
Oops!...You think I'm in love

20
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,540
That I'm sent from above

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,410
I'm not that innocent

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,900
You see my problem is this

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm dreaming away

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,750
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,040
I cry, watching the days

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,620
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

27
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,680
But to lose all my senses

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,950
That is just so typically me

29
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,030
Baby, oh

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,930
Oops!...I did it again

31
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,940
I played with your heart, got lost in the game

32
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,330
Oh baby, baby

33
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,940
Oops!...You think I'm in love

"All aboard"

39
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,210
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"

40
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,880
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this...?"

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,810
"Yeah, yes it is"

42
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,490
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,340
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"

44
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,910
"Oh, you shouldn't have"

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,380
Oops!...I did it again to your heart

46
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,610
Got lost in this game, oh baby

47
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:24,070
