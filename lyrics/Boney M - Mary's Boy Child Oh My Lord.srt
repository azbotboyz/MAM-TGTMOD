00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,920
Long time ago in Bethlehem,

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,630
so the Holy Bible said,

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,740
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ,

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,530
was born on Christmas Day.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,430
Hark, now hear the angels sing,

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,730
a king was born today,

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,040
And man will live for evermore,

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,340
because of Christmas Day.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,570
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ,

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,620
was born on Christmas Day.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,660
While shepherds watch their flocks by night,

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,510
they see a bright new shining star,

21
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,210
they hear a choir sing a song,

22
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,570
the music seemed to come from afar.

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,320
Hark, now hear the angels sing,

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,620
a king was born today,

25
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,780
And man will live for evermore,

26
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,930
because of Christmas Day.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,400
For a moment the world was aglow,

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
all the bells rang out

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,380
there were tears of joy and laughter,

35
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,020
people shouted "let everyone know,

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,880
there is hope for all to find peace".

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,630
And then they found a little nook

38
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,450
in a stable all forlorn,

39
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,530
and in a manger cold and dark,

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,460
Mary's little boy was born.

41
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,410
Hark, now hear the angels sing,

42
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,770
a king was born today,

43
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,900
And man will live for evermore,

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,540
because of Christmas Day.

45
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,740
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ,

46
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,190
was born on Christmas Day.

47
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,060
Oh a moment still worth was a glow,

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,180
all the bells rang out

49
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,750
there were tears of joy and laughter,

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,490
people shouted "let everyone know,

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,170
there is hope for all to find peace".

52
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,280
Oh my Lord

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,510
You sent your son to save us

54
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,630
Oh my Lord

55
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,870
Your very self you gave us

56
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,930
Oh my Lord

57
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,190
That sin may not enslave us

58
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,960
And love may reign once more

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,530
Oh my Lord

60
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,750
when in the crib they found him

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,800
Oh my Lord

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,000
A golden halo crowned him

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,030
Oh my Lord

64
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,210
They gathered all around him

65
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,840
To see him and adore

66
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,670
(This day will live forever)

67
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,900
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)

68
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,960
They had become to doubt you

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,130
Oh my Lord (He is the truth forever)

70
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,190
What did they know about you

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,300
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)

72
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,380
But they were lost without you

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,720
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

74
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,820
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)

75
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,940
with the child's adoration

76
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,090
Oh my lord (He is a personation)

77
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,270
There came great jubilation

78
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,480
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,590
And full of admiration

80
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,110
They realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky)

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,980
Oh my Lord (Oh praise the Lord)

82
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,160
You sent your son to save us

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,310
Oh my Lord (This day will live forever)

84
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,470
Your very self you gave us

85
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,520
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)

86
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
That sin may not enslave us

87
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,812
And love may reign once more
