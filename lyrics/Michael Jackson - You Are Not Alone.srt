00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,610
Another day has gone

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,580
I'm still all alone

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,530
How could this be

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,550
You're not here with me

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,400
You never said goodbye

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,510
Someone tell me why

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,430
Did you have to go

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,180
And leave my world so cold

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,160
Everyday I sit and ask myself

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,460
How did love slip away

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,430
Something whispers in my ear and says

17
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,540
That you are not alone

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,450
For I am here with you

19
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,470
Though you're far away

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,380
I am here to stay

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,280
You are not alone

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,320
I am here with you

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,300
Though we're far apart

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,280
You're always in my heart

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,510
You are not alone

26
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:51,620
All alone

27
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,350
Why, oh

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,360
Just the other night

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,260
I thought I heard you cry

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,050
Asking me to come

31
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,280
And hold you in my arms

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,220
I can hear your prayers

33
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,110
Your burdens I will bear

34
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,090
But first I need your hand

35
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,030
So forever can begin

36
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,830
Everyday I sit and ask myself

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,190
How did love slip away

38
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,210
Then something whispers in my ear and says

39
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,200
That you are not alone

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,170
For I am here with you

41
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,180
Though you're far away

42
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,100
I am here to stay

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,120
For you are not alone

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,100
I am here with you

45
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,150
Though we're far apart

46
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,870
You're always in my heart

47
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,110
And you are not alone

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,760
Oh...

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,220
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'

50
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,990
Fly...

51
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:39,520
And girl you know that I'll be there

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,140
I'll be there

53
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,100
You are not alone

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,010
I am here with you

55
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,060
Though you're far away

56
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,130
I am here to stay

57
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,100
You are not alone

58
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,000
I am here with you

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,980
Though we're far apart

60
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,990
You're always in my heart

61
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,960
You are not alone(You are not alone)

62
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,930
For I am here with you(I am here with you)

63
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,060
Though you're far away(Though you're far away)

64
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,970
I am here to stay(And you with me)

65
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,180
For you are not alone(You're always)

66
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,220
In my heart.....For I am here with you

67
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,210
Heart.....Though we're far apart

68
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,130
Heart.....You're always in my heart

69
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,320
For you are not alone

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,490
Not alone

71
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:05,540
You are not alone, you are not alone...

72
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,320
You are not alone, you are not alone...

73
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,330
Not alone, not alone

74
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,990
You just reach for me girl

75
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,490
In the morning in the evening

76
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,190
Not alone, not alone

77
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,080
And you with me, not alone

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:45,521
Oh, together, together...
