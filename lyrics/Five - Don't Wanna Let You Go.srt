00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,690
Don't wanna let you go

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,920
We just wanna tell you

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,170
Just wanna let you know

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,530
That we'll stay around

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,890
So what else can you do

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,200
You've said all you have to

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,490
We're coming after you

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,970
So don't make a sound

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,770
Don't wanna let you go

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,880
I got this feelin

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,490
Could it be there's someone watching over me

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,790
Tell me who you are

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,210
I close my eyes and count from nine

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,760
To try and find some peace of mind

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,410
But it's gone too far

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,550
You see our faces every time you turn your head around

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,780
We'll be watching even when you turn the lights down

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,850
We will always be around no matter where you are

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,040
Don't wanna let you go

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,320
We just wanna tell you

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Just wanna let you know

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,860
That we'll stay around

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,220
So what else can you do

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,590
You've said all you have to

30
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,770
We're coming after you

31
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,400
So don't make a sound

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
Don't wanna let you go

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,410
I'm all alone now in the dark

34
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,810
Just one chance so we can talk

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,300
That is all I ask

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,720
I close my eyes and then I dream

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,200
I always wake up to a scream

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,150
Wonder where you are

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,950
Don't you know we're always gonna be around you

40
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,410
And there really isn't anything you can do

41
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,140
We will always be around no matter where you are

42
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,440
Don't wanna let you go

43
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,680
We just wanna tell you

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,040
Just wanna let you know

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,290
That we'll stay around

46
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,720
So what else can you do

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,020
