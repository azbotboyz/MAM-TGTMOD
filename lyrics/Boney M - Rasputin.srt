6
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,880
There lived a certain man in Russia long ago

7
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,570
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow

8
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,950
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear

9
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,260
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear

10
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,880
He could preach the bible like a preacher

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,840
Full of ecstacy and fire

12
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,510
But he also was the kind of teacher

13
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,700
Women would desire

14
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,280
RA RA RASPUTIN

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,500
Lover of the Russian queen

16
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,910
There was a cat that really was gone

17
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,380
RA RA RASPUTIN

18
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,130
Russia's greatest love machine

19
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,930
It was a shame how he carried on

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,910
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar

26
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,090
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar

27
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,440
In all affairs of state he was the man to please

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,820
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,450
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer

30
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,320
Though she'd heard the things he'd done

31
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,070
She believed he was a holy healer

32
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,070
Who would heal her son

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,760
RA RA RASPUTIN

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,090

RA RA RASPUTIN

37
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,720
Russia's greatest love machine

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,130
It was a shame how he carried on

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,500
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,540
for power became known to more and more people,

41
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,910
the demands to do something about this outrageous

42
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,110
man became louder and louder.

48
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,060
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies

49
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,250
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"

50
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,700
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms

51
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,150
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms

52
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,720
Then one night some men of higher standing

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,440
Set a trap, they're not to blame

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,250
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,190
And he really came

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,900
RA RA RASPUTIN

57
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,280
Lover of the Russian queen

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,500
They put some poison into his wine

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
RA RA RASPUTIN

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,880
Russia's greatest love machine

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,310
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"

62
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,000
RA RA RASPUTIN

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,310
Lover of the Russian queen

64
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,640
They didn't quit, they wanted his head

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,570
RA RA RASPUTIN

66
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,960
Russia's greatest love machine

67
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,250
And so they shot him till he was dead

68
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,600
Oh, those Russians..
