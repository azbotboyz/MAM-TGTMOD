00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,040
Love delight - deep inside

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,460
I'm sharing all my love with you

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,470
Oh, why I know I can't live without you girl ?

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:38,440
I can't live without you

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,200
Take me away - make my day

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,580
Every time I see your face

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,470
Oh, why I know I can't live without your love ?

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,840
That I can't live without you

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,600
There's one life to live

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,940
And one heart to give

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,490
Tell me that you need, body heat

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,920
Just turn out the lights

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,810
You and me - dreams are free

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,450
Just a woman and a man, babe

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,600
You and me - can't you see

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,820
That I'm doing what I can, babe

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,300
Babe, you and me - ecstasy

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,610
And I never want to lose you

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,970
To the end of the world

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh, I'll stay by your side

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,760
You and me - oh, I feel

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,180
Like the moon was made for lonely

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,670
You and me - and it's real

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,780
You are the one and you're the only

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,200
You and me - memories

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,620
All the love that's never ending

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,860
To the end of the world

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,990

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,170
It's getting late

38
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,530
And I can wait

39
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,900
The ocean beating in my heart

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,900
Oh, why I know I can't live without you girl ?

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,850
I can't live without you

42
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,140
I call your name

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,470
Again and again

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,750
I lose my soul, my self control

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,790
Oh, why I know that I can't live without your love ?

46
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,760
