00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,800
She really moved them down

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,470
She had no heart at all

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,460
No no no heart at all

Oh she was really tough

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,810
She left her husband flat

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,610
He wasn't tough enough

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,620
She took her boys along

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,370

Don't anybody move!

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,710
One day they robbed a bank

62
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,490
It was their last hooray

63
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,220
The cops appeared too soon

64
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,990
They could't get away

65
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,770
And all the loot they had

66
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,640
It made them mighty mad

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,380
And so they shot it out

68
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,190
Ma Baker and her sons

69
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,050
They didn't waant to hang

70
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,820
They died with blazing guns

71
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,620
And so the story ends

72
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,640
Of one who left no friends

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,820
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker

74
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,310
She taught her four sons

75
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,490
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker

76
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,980
To handle their guns

77
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,030
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker

78
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,590
She never could cry

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,650
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker

80
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:58,814
But she knew how to die
