00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,540
You tell me you're in love with me

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,480
That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,540
It's not that I don't want to stay

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,510
But everytime you come to close I move away

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,120
I wanna believe in everything that you say

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,250
Because it sounds so good

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,310
But if you really want me, move it slow

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,810
There's things about me you just have to know

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,190
Sometimes I run Sometimes I hide

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,750
sometimes I'm scared of you

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,680
But all I really want is to hold you tight

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,880
Treat you right, be with you day and night

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,750
baby all I need is time

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,830
I don't wanna be so shy, uh-uh

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,780
Everytime I am alone I wonder why

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,280
Hope that you will wait for me

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,410
You see that, you're the only one for me

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,040
I wanna believe in everything that you say

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,280
Cause it sounds so good

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,220
but if you really want me, move it slow

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,600
There's things about me, you just have to know

26
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,160
Sometimes I run (Sometimes) Sometimes I hide

27

The way that I trust in you

37
