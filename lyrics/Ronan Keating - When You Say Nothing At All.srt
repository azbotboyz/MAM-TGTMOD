00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:23,120
It’s amazing how you can speak right to my heart

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:33,470
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:39,480
Try as I may I can never explain

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:48,530
What I hear when you don’t say a thing

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:54,060
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,600
There’s a truth in your eyes saying you’ll never leave me

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:10,740
The touch of your hands say you’ll catch me wherever I fall

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,130
You say it best when you say nothing at all

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:27,950
All day long I can hear people talking out loud

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:49,360
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,350
Try as they may they could never define

22
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,600
What’s been said between your heart and mind

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,140
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,650
There’s a truth in your eyes saying you’ll never leave me

25
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:23,930
