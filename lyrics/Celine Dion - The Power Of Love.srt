1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,960
The whispers in the morning

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,790
Of lovers sleeping tight

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:20,510
Are rolling like thunder now

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:27,380
As I look in your eyes

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:34,230
I hold on to your body

6
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,100
And feel each move you make

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,420
Your voice is warm and tender

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:54,660
A love that I could not forsake

9
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,540
'Coz I am your lady

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:08,220
And you are my man

11
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,010
Whenever you reach for me

12
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,310
I'll do all that I can

13
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:29,100
Lost is how I'm feeling,

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,850
lying in your arms.

15
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,620
When the world outside's too much to take

16
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:49,490
that all ends when I'm with you.

17
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:56,120
Even though there may be times,

18
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:03,330
it seems I'm far away,

19
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,590
never wonder where I am,

20
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:15,160
'cause I am always by your side.

21
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,500
'Coz I am your lady

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,220
And you are my man

23
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:37,060
Whenever you reach for me

24
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,090
I'll do all that I can

25
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,650
We're heading for something

26
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,650
Somewhere I've never been

27
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,030
Sometimes I am frightened

28
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,450
But I'm ready to learn

29
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:11,110
Of the power of love

30
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:28,740
The sound of your heart beating made it clear.

31
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,330
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on

32
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,710
is light years away.

33
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,070
'Coz I am your lady

34
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:55,730
And you are my man

35
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:02,190

36
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,710

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,570
Sometimes I am frightened

40
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,150
