00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,060
Every night in my dreams

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,860
I see you. I feel you.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:39,440
That is how I know you go on.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,760
Far across the distance

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,430
And spaces between us

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:57,810
You have come to show you go on.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,420
Near, far, wherever you are

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:18,400
I believe that the heart does go on

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,950
Once more you open the door

15
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,390
And you're here in my heart

16
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,840
And my heart will go on and on

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,880
Love can touch us one time

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,930
And last for a lifetime

24
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:04,100
And never go 'til we're one

25
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,020
Love was when I loved you

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,250
One true time I hold to

27
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:23,480
In my life we'll always go on

28
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:34,600
Near, far, wherever you are

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:43,330
I believe that the heart does go on

30
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,710
(Why does the heart go on)

31
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:54,000
Once more you open the door

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,040
And you're here in my heart

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:07,040
And my heart will go on and on

And I know that my heart will go on

41
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:52,040
We'll stay forever this way

42
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,320
You are safe in my heart

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:06,980
