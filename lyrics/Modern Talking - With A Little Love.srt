00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,700
They said : Oh yeah, it's a tough world

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,050
You're restless and you're young

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,910
I said : Oh girl, it's a good twirl

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:36,230
And your time will come, your time will come

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,190
They said : you came from the wrong side

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,770
He's a page from the end of the book

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,210
I said : You came from the right side

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,420
Took me just one look

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,200
Then you understood

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,580
With a little love

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,570
You will survive

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,690
With a little love

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,740
You will get by

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,740
Do what you want

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,750
Go your own way

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,060
'Cause its your life

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,150
With a little love

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,070
You'll make a start

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,350
Yeah, why lovers break each other's heart

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,280
Do what you want

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,020

They said : no future forget it

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,860
You came from the wrong side of town

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,900
I said : don't listen, don't let it

36
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,910
Let it bring you down

37
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,230
Make you wear a frown

38
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:11,360
They said : Oh let him down easy

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,850
Laugh at the heart you have won

40
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,510
I said : that life is for living

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,400
Like the morning sun

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,280
It had just began

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,500
