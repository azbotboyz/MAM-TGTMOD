6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,830
Love is easy

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,940
Hate is wrong

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,050
Find the way, babe

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,030
Way back home

10
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,340
Give your heart

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,700
Love will never die

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:55,160
Or a little cloud will cry

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,320
Be a dreamer - be a fool

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,490
Come and break all this rules

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,090
Better late than never done

16
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,000
For the children

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,550
We need a home

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,440
Give me peace on earth

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,730
Give me all your love

20
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,320
Say, that we won't fighting

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,390
For the peace of all

22
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,960
Give me peace on earth

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,180
Give me all your love

24
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,460
For the little children

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,310
For the peace of all

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,570
Come together - turn a dream

27
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:30,410
For the children, love is all we need

28
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,140
All the wrongs don't make it right

29
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,050
For the children we will fight

30
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,610
Give me peace on earth

31
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,900
Give me all your love

32
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,510
Say, that we won't fighting

33
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:11,460
For the peace of all

34
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,750
Give me peace on earth

35
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,040
Give me all your love

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,390
For the little children

37
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,250
For the peace of all

38
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:43,180
Give me peace on earth

39
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,460
Give me all your love

40
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,780
Say, that we won't fighting

41
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:15,007
For the peace of all
