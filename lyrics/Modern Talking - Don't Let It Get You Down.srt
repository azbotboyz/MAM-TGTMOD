5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,910
I'm crying through the night

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,090
A cry of loneliness

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,670
Strangers side by side looking for a kiss

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,700
You feel your heart is dead

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,890
Oh like a broken toy

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,500
Oh blue eyes, don't cry

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,410
Your heart is out of tune

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,690
These tears can never dry

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,940
I'll save your heart, babe, soon

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,210
Oh baby give a try

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,380
A sound of breakin' hearts

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,420
I hear again and again

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,340
Oh, I'll be there

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,620
Take my helping hand

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:08,650
Don't let it get you down

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,920
It's never too late

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,040
Don't leave this heartbreak town

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,420
Feel the love we'll make

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,340
Harder you'll try the more you get

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,640
Oh your heartbeat is too sad

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,920
Come keep your heart just burning in the night

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,330
For you and me

31
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,100
You're tired of been alone

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,330
But time is on your side

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,570
You'll make it on your own

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,760
Baby, if you'll try

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,930
Holding back the tears and mend a broken heart

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:20,520
Oh blue eyes, don't cry

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,620
Never give you up

38
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,830
Somewhere there's a friend

39
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,070
When rain is in your heart

40
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,270
Babe, don't let it end

41
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,350
Oh light the flame of love

42
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,460
Oh, call me just again

43
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,420
Oh, I'll be there

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,330
Where the rainbow en

45
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,870
Don't let it get you down

46
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:57,050
It's never too late

47
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:03,510
Don't leave this heartbreak town

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,940
For you and me

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:39,637
For you and me
