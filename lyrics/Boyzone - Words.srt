00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,720
Smile, an everlasting smile

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,340
A smile can bring you near to me

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,440
Don't ever let me find you wrong

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,310
Cause that would bring a tear to me

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,100
This world has lost it's glory

Now my love

13
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,750
You think that I don't even mean

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,800
A single word I say...

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,460
It's only words

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,320
And words are all I have

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,550
To take your heart away

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,960
Talk, in everlasting words

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,290
And dedicate them all, to me

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,600
And I will give you all my life

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,250
I'm here if you should call to me
