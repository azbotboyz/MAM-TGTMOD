00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,870
The times were hard and I was running

7
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,300
I could feel my chance was coming

8
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,830
Another time, another place

9
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,390
A pillow filled with frozen tears

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,830
See the gates, a distant fire

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,290
Shows the way, to my desire

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,780
Laying down my heart for you

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,130
'Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue

14
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,810
I know that I'll never die on love

15
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,700
But I'll never get enough

16
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,190
Oh, I got no time to lose

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,170
On my avenue to a jet airliner

18
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,710
Avenue to my broken dreams

19
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,050
My avenue to a jet airliner

20
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,660
Like an old old movie-scene

21
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,070
My avenue to a jet airliner

22
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,930
Brings me back to the dreams I loved

23
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,000
Good guys only win in movies

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,950
But this time babe I'll get enough

30
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,050
Love can breed misunderstanding

31
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,470
But my heart will soon be landing

32
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,940
Another love on golden wings

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,490
Oh, I'll buy you diamond rings

34
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,910
Waitin' for a lonely rainbow

35
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,390
Magic wave where will I go

36
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,880
Breaking down my heart to you

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,110
'Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue

38
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,050
I know that I'll never die on love

My avenue to a jet airliner

44
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,550
Like an old old movie-scene
