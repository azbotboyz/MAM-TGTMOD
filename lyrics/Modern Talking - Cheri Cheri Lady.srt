00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,630
Oh, I cannot explain

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,680
Every time it's the same

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,790
More I feel that it's real

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,910
Take my heart

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,960
I've been lonely to long

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,140
Oh, I can't be so strong

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,250
Take the chance for romance, take my heart

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,420
I need you so

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,710
There's no time

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,270
I'll ever go

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,440
Cheri, cheri lady

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,490
Going through emotion

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,610
Love is where you find it

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,720
Listen to your heart

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,840
Cheri, cheri lady

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,890
Living in devotion

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,950
It's always like the first time

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,120
Let me take a part

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,180
Cheri, cheri lady

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,220
Like there's no tomorrow

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,410
Take my heart - don't lose it

27
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,460
Listen to your heart

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,580
Cheri, cheri lady

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,700
To know you is to love you

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,560
If you call me baby I'll be always yours

All my world turns around

38
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,690
Who is right ? Who is wrong ?

39
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,870
I don't know

40
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,920
I've got pain in my heart

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,970
Got some love in my soul

42
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,140
Easy come, but I think easy go

43
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,320
I need you so

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,310
Although times

45
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,130
I move so slow

46
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,100
Cheri, cheri lady

47
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,210
