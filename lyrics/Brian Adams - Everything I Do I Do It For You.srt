00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:22,600
Look into my eyes - you will see

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,060
What you mean to me

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:36,650
Search your heart - search your soul

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,330
And when you find me

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,120
there you'll search no more

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,280
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,300
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,730
You know it's true

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:14,600
Everything I do - I do it for you

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,830
Look into my heart - you will find

16
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:27,290
There's nothin' there to hide

17
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:35,140
Take me as I am - take my life

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:42,290
I would give it all I would sacrifice

19
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:50,070
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for

20
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,240
I can't help it

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,980
there's nothin' I want more

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,460
You know it's true

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:10,410
Everything I do - I do it for you

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,770
There's no love - like your love

25
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:26,090
And no other - could give more love

26
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:33,380
There's nowhere - unless you're there

27
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:43,130
All the time - all the way

I would fight for you - I'd lie for you

38
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:44,360
Walk the wire for you - Ya I'd die for you

39
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,260
Ya know it's true

40
00:03:50,260 --> 00:04:03,740
