00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,070
No woman no cry

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,700
No woman no cry

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,250
No woman no cry

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,610
No woman no cry

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,310
Cause i remember when we used to sit

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,830
In a government yard in trenchtown

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,610
Observing the hypocrites

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,170
Mingle with the good people we meet

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,060
Good friends we have, now

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,510
Good friends we have lost

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,510
Along the way

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,400
In this great future,

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,320
You can't forget your past

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,540
So dry your tears, i say

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,930
No woman no cry

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,220
No woman no cry

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,060
Oh little darling, don't shed no tears

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,060
No woman no cry

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,630
Cause i remember when we used to sit

25
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,380
In the government yard in trenchtown

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,190
When georgie would make the fire lights

27
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,180
I say, log would burnin' through the nights

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,690
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge

29
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,340
Of which I’ll share with you

30
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,930
My feet is my only carriage

31
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,490
So I’ve got to push on thru,

32
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,600
And while I’m gone

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,900
Everything 's gonna be alright

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,230
Everything 's gonna be alright

35
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,540
Everything 's gonna be alright now

36
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,830
Everything 's gonna be alright

37
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,170
Everything 's gonna be alright now

38
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,230
Everything 's gonna be alright

39
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,680
No woman no cry

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,100
