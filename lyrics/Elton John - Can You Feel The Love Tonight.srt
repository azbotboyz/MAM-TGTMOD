6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There's a calm surrender

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
To the rush of day

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When the heat of the rolling world

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Can be turned away

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And enchanted moment

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And it sees me through

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's enough for this restless

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Just to be with you

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And can you feel the love tonight?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It is where we are

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It is enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That we got this far

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And can you feel the love tonight?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How it's laid to rest

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,990
Believe the very best

27
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,510
There's a time for everyone

28
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,000
If they only learn

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That the twisting kaleidoscope

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Moves us all in turn

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's a phyme and reason

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To the wild outdoors

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Beats in time with yours

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And can you feel the love tonight?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It is where we are

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It is enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That we got this far

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And can you feel the love tonight?

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How it's laid to rest

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Believe the very best

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:58,654
Believe the very best
